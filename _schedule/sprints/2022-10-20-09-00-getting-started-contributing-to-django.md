title: Getting started contributing to Django.
---

Getting going contributing to Django can feel a little intimidating. Where do I start?

We'll introduce you to Django's code base, get you set up running the tests, and building the docs.

Next up we'll hit the issue tracker, and get a feel for that. Then we'll find a ticket, roll-up our sleeves and see what it's all about.

Most tickets aren't impossibly hard. Rather they need time and bit of love from you to get them resolved. We'll see that in action.

It's your first step on your contributor journey.
