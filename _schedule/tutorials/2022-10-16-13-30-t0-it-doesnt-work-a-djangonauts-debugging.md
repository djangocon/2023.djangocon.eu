Debugging is the unsung skill for a developer. Eventually all developers encounter a 500 error, a blank page or perhaps the worst of them all, the phrase “it doesn’t work.” This tutorial will help prepare you for that inevitable bout with bewilderment by showcasing the tools and debugging strategies available to Django developers.

This tutorial is best suited for beginner developers, folks new to Django or new to web development. The topics this tutorial will cover are:

- Debugging
- Reading a stacktrace.
- Using the browser developer tools.
- Using the Django Debug Toolbar.
- Looking at Django source code to understand how it works.
- Profiling a method.
- Analyzing a SQL query

For the two labs in the tutorial,  starter code will be provided so you can follow along or go at your own pace. If you choose to implement this code you will need the following:

- Python 3.7+
- Foundational knowledge of Python
- Basic understanding of Django
  - Completing the Django Girls or standard Django tutorial should suffice.
- A desire to learn
