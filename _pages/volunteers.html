      <p>Do you have a couple (or more) hours of your time to spare?
      DjangoCon Europe is entirely organised and run by the Python and Django community.
      All of our core organising team are volunteers who have given up their time over the past several months to prepare for the conference.
      However we are only a few, and we need some help from you to make sure the conference runs as smoothly as possible.</p>
      <p>Everyone who is attending DjangoCon Europe is welcome to volunteer, but you must be registered in order to volunteer.
      All help is very much appreciated.</p>

      <h2>Why should you volunteer?</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>It’s a chance to meet new people and possibly make friends with people you may not have met otherwise. If you’re new to DjangoCon Europe, volunteering is a great way to connect with other attendees.</li>
        <li>It’s a great opportunity to discover a career path: volunteering provides individuals with new experiences and skills.</li>
        <li>Session chairing is a great way to get to meet the speakers!</li>
        <li>You’ll get insight into what’s involved in running the conference and contribute to the team!</li>
      </ul>
