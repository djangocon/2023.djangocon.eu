Ticket sales are now open!

# What ticket should I buy?

If you are paying for your own ticket, you should buy an **Individual** ticket. If your company 
is paying, you should buy a **Corporate** ticket. 

You can also buy a **supporter** ticket if you want to go above and beyond and support our mission!
These tickets will allow us to offer discounted and free tickets to people who couldn't otherwise
afford to attend.

If you are a student or without income, a **discounted** ticket is available. This ticket type does not cover our costs for the conference, but weâ€™re able to offer it thanks to the generosity of our
sponsors and attendees who purchase supporter tickets.

## Don't Forget!

- If your employer is paying, please use the corporate rate.


## Cancellation and refund policy

In line with our [COVID-19 policy](/covid19-policy), you may request a refund at any time, for any reason. If you need to cancel your ticket, please send an email to [{{ site.contact_us_email }}](mailto:{{ site.contact_us_email }}).

Tickets may be transferred to someone else at no charge.


**DjangoCon Europe sold out in 2022, so buy your ticket soon!**
