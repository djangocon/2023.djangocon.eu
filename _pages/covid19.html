              In order to keep conference attendees safe, DjangoCon US will have an indoor mask mandate along with a vaccine verification process in-person in San Diego as well as an online verification before the conference. If you are not familiar, we suggest you check out the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html">CDC's Domestic Travel guidelines to stay safe</a>.
              <br />
              <br />
              For vaccine verification, we will be using <a href="https://shareemy.health/">Share My Health</a>, a third-party vendor recognized as a leader in the space, which PyCon US 2022 also used. In order to pass the vaccine verification, you must have be up to date on your vaccine (including eligible boosters). We will be sending the instructions to in-person ticket-holders to verify your vaccine status prior to the conference.
              <br />
              <br />
              The conference will provide KN95 and/or N95 masks for people to wear. We will be asking that all attendees wear a certified KN95 / N95 mask while inside. 
              <br />
              <br />
              Similar to PyCon US 2022, we will have a three strike policy for masks not being worn inside the venue. If you are seen without a mask on, you will be issued a strike by the organizing committee. Upon receiving your third strike, you will not be allowed to enter the venue and will not be issued a refund. Please make our job easy and keep your mask on while inside at all times.
              <br />
              <br />
              If you have questions about the COVID-19 policy, please <a href="mailto:{{site.contact_us_email}}">email us</a>. If you need a medical exemption or the like, sending us an email is also the right course of action. If you are not interested in attending in person due to the mask and vaccine requirements, you are welcome to book an <a href="{{site.ticket_link}}">online ticket</a>.
