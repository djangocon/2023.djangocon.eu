We want DjangoCon Europe to be as inclusive and welcoming as possible to everyone.

Here are some of the ways we're trying to do that. If there's something you need that
we aren't currently doing, please [let us know]({{ mailto:{{ site.contact_us_email }} }}) and we'll try our best to help!


## Child Care and Breastfeeding

A free cr√®che will be available on-site at the Assembly Rooms during the 3 days of
talks and workshops (for children from 6 months to 16 years).  We just need you to register in advance
when you buy your tickets, so we can ensure we have the appropriate numbers of staff available.

Children are also welcome everywhere during the conference.

If you are breastfeeding your baby, we can provide a quiet room if you prefer. Otherwise, please breastfeed your baby whenever and wherever you like, including during talks and at mealtimes.

If your child is old enough to have meals and refreshments with us, they are welcome to join us. If they are not, you will need to provide their food.


## Accessibility and support for special needs

We have provision for people with hearing, vision and mobility requirements.

### Hearing support

Talks in the main hall will feature simultaneous speech-to-text transcription.

The venue has an induction loop accessible in the main auditorium and refreshment areas.  Attendees should switch their hearing aids to the 'T' position.


### Vision support

Preferred seating will be provided and reserved for the visually-impaired. Please contact us about any lighting requirements you may have, and we will do our best to meet them.

Similarly, if you would benefit from having a close-up display of presenters' slides and screens, or from the provision of any assistive technology, just let us know.

Guide dogs are welcome at the conference and social events.

Directional signage is in Braille located throughout the Assembly Rooms. 
Within the building there are also call buttons for assistance if required.

### Mobility support

#### The Assembly Rooms (talks/workshops)
Talks and workshops will take place on the first floor of the Assembly Rooms.  

Access into the venue is flat, with no steps.  To access the first floor, there is a lift to the right of the foyer. The lift is spacious and includes grab bars for assistance. The lift also includes spoken messages.

There are accessible bathrooms on the first floor.

Please contact us about any mobility assistance needs you may have. There is some accessible parking in front of the Assembly Rooms and on George Street which can be 
arranged with the venue.

#### The Biscuit Factory (sprints)

Sprints will take place on the ground floor.  The venue is fully wheelchair accessible, with step-free street access right through to the main space. 

#### The Caves (social event)

The ground floor of The Caves is fully accessible, with a disabled toilet, apart from 2 steps down to the bar area. The first floor is not accessible as there are several stairs to get up and no lift.


## Dietary requirements

We aim to meet a wide range of dietary requirements.  You will be able to specify any requirements
when purchasing your ticket.  

We will publish a menu for each day (including allergy information) closer to the event.

## Quiet room

We will provide a clearly-marked designated quiet room at the venue.

This room is intended to be a calm and quiet place for anyone who needs to have a break from the bustle of the conference, and will not be used for socialising.

## Dress code

We want everyone to feel comfortable at DjangoCon Europe, and that includes wearing
whatever clothing that makes you feel comfortable.  We do not have a formal dress code. 
As long as your outfit does not violate the [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct), you are welcome to wear whatever you wish.

## Opportunity grants

Some attendees will require help in order to attend the conference. 

Our [opportunity grants programme](/opportunity-grants) is open for application until 31st March 2023.
