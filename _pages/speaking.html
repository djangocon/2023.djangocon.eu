      <h3>About Presenting Virtually</h3>
      <p>Will this be your first time presenting virtually at a conference? We're here to help!</p>

      <p>You will pre-record your talk{% comment %} or tutorial{% endcomment %}; you won't be presenting it live. We will provide you with instructions and technical help, if you need it, to make your presentation the best it can be.</p>

      <h2>Proposing to DjangoCon EU</h2>

      <h3>Selection process</h3>

      <p>We’ll choose a selection of talks {% comment %}and tutorials{% endcomment %}that we feel add up to the most enjoyable and engaging program for our attendees. Volunteers from the Django community are invited to help us pick talks, and we rely heavily on them to help us select ones that are interesting and beneficial to our attendees. Community volunteers and conference organizers will all be reviewing anonymized submissions and collectively deciding which ones to accept. We’ll publish the list of selected talks as soon as we can after the deadline.</p>

      <p>Check out our <a href="{{ site.cfp_application }}/">CFP</a> for example talk and tutorial proposals.</p>

      <h3>Talks (October 22nd &amp; 23rd)</h3>

      <p>Length: 25 minutes or 45 minutes</p>

      <p>We are looking for original and interesting talks that can benefit the diverse interests of our audience. Don’t feel boxed into Django-centric themes; we also love talks about community, web development, user experience, and more. If you’re a first timer - don’t fret! We would love to be remembered as the conference where you started your speaking career.</p>

      <p>Here are some examples of what has been accepted over the last couple of years:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://2019.djangocon.us/talks/">DjangoCon EU 2019 Talks</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://2018.djangocon.us/talks/">DjangoCon EU 2018 Talks</a></li>
      </ul>

      {% comment %}
      <h3>Tutorials (October 21)</h3>

      <p>Length: 3-3.5 hours</p>

      <p>We’re open to all kinds of ideas, especially ones we haven’t thought of! Technical tutorials tend to be more popular, but we welcome all topics. Tutorials can be targeted at any experience level &mdash; just be sure to indicate clearly what you expect your students to already know or have experience with.</p>

      <p>Still unsure if you should submit? Not only will we cover your DjangoCon EU ticket, but tutorials are compensated.</p>
      {% endcomment %}

      <h3>Platicas en Español</h3>

      <p>Por primera vez tendremos un track 100% destinado a platicas en Español. Duración: ~30 - 45 minutos.</p>

      <p>Estamos abiertos a todo tipo de ideas, ¡especialmente a aquellas en las que no hemos pensado! Pueden estar dirigidos a cualquier nivel de experiencia, sobre cualquier tema (programación o no).</p>
