## Why Sponsor DjangoCon Europe?

This will be the 15th DjangoCon Europe, and is being held in Edinburgh from the 29th May to the 2nd June. DjangoCon Europe is the biggest dedicated Django conference in Europe and attracts many of the World's leading Django developers to speak, conduct workshops and share knowledge.

If you're looking to hire developers, promote a product that's useful to developers, promote awareness of your organisation, or just give something back to the community, then you should sponsor DjangoCon Europe.

DjangoCon Europe has existed for more than a decade and is professionally run by passionate volunteers, and on a not-for-profit basis.

## Sponsorship Packages

The following table details the core sponsorship levels. We have several different packages that offer different levels of visibility, but all will show your organisation's support of the Django Community, both on the screen during the conference, in printed materials.

Gold sponsorship and above includes a booth, which will be placed in the Assembly Rooms' main ballroom, alongside the stations that will provide food and drink at various points during the conference. Gold sponsorship and above will also feature at the start of each talk when they are published on YouTube and thus provide excellent visibility outside of the conference itself.
