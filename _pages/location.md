        Edinburgh is Scotland’s capital city, and the most visited city in the UK after
        London.  It is perhaps best known as the home of the Edinburgh Fringe and
        International Festivals in August each year, but there is plenty to experience at
        any time of year.  Many attractions and landmarks are within a few minutes walk of
        the conference venue, including Princes Street Gardens, the Scott Monument, the
        historic Old Town, the monuments and observatory at Calton Hill, and of course
        Edinburgh Castle and the Royal Mile.

      Edinburgh’s weather is reliably unpredictable.  May/June are typically some of the
      warmer and drier months of the year, but you should be prepared for any weather!
      It’s a good idea to have lightweight waterproof clothes with you, no matter how nice
      it looks first thing in the morning!

    <h3>By Air</h3>
    <p>
      Edinburgh Airport is just 6 miles from the centre, with direct flights to many
      destinations around the world. You can easily get to the centre of the city in
      around 20 minutes by taxi, bus & tram. You can find more information on getting into
      the city from the airport on the <a href="http://www.edinburghairport.com/transport-links">airport website</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://www.edinburghairport.com/transport-links/buses-and-coaches/edinburgh-city-bus-links">airport bus services</a> are frequent, convenient and inexpensive.  The <a href="https://www.edinburghairport.com/transport-links/trams">tram</a> is also a convenient way to get into the city centre.
    </p>
    <h3>By Train</h3>
    <p>
      There are two train stations in the centre of the city, Edinburgh Waverley, and
      Edinburgh Haymarket. It is approximately a 10 minute walk to the Assembly Rooms from
      Waverley, and 20 minutes from Haymarket. If you're travelling by train it's much
      cheaper to book in advance. You can book tickets online on the <a href="https://thetrainline.com">Trainline</a>.

  <div class="row column">
  <p>
    Edinburgh provides a large number and wide range of different hotels categories,
    which you can book on the usual online sites such as <a href="https://booking.com">Booking.com</a> and <a href="https://uk.hotels.com/">Hotels.com</a>. Also check
    out accommodation links on
    <a href="https://www.visitscotland.com/destinations-maps/edinburgh/accommodation">Visit Scotland</a>
    and <a href="https://edinburgh.org/accommodation/">Forever Edinburgh</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    Edinburgh is a popular tourist destination, and hotels can be in high demand,
    especially during the spring and summer months, so we recommend booking your
    accommodation as son as possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to hotels, Edinburgh has lots of guesthouses, bed & breakfasts and hostels which can be a more affordable option for city centre locations.
  </p>
  <p>
    In particular, some of Edinburgh's hostels are located in awesome interesting and historic buildings, and very central locations:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://codecoliving.com/">CoDE Co-Living - The Loft</a><br/>Located on
      Rose Street, and a one minute walk to the conference venue!</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.codehostels.com/hostels/the-court/">CoDE Pod – The CoURT</a><br/>A former courthouse and jail transformed into a luxury pod hostel, Located just off the Royal Mile</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.highstreethostel.com/">High Street Hostel</a><br/>A 16th
      century building, also located just off the Royal Mile</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.castlerockedinburgh.com/">Castle Rock Hostel</a><br/>Located
      right beneath the Castle in the historic Old Town.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.haystackhostel.com/">Haystack Hostel</a><br/>Located by
      Waverley train station, between the Old and New Towns</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Private holiday letting companies such as <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/edinburgh-scotland/stays">AirBnB</a> and <a href="https://www.vrbo.com/en-gb/search/keywords:edinburgh-scotland-united-kingdom">Vrbo</a> also have a presence in the city.
  </p>
  <p>
    Edinburgh has extremely good public transport links, and the conference venue is accessible by the majority of bus routes as well as tram links.  There are also
    a number of bicycle hire options (including e-bikes - the city is built on seven hills after all!).  If you're thinking of staying a bit further out of the city centre, have a look at our <a href="/location/#getting-around">guide to getting around</a> below
    for more information on transport links.

    <h2 id="getting-around-heading">Getting around</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="row column">
    <h3>By Foot</h3>
    <p>
      Edinburgh is a safe and walkable city, and the main conference venue, the Assembly
      Rooms, is located on George Street, in the very centre of the city.
    </p>
    <h3>By Bus & Tram</h3>
    <p>
      Edinburgh has an excellent bus and tram network.  <a href="https://www.lothianbuses.com/">Lothian Buses</a> are the main city buses; the easiest way to buy tickets is with
      contactless payments on the bus; just tap when you get on - your card will be
      charged at the end of the day with the capped daily rate.  You can also buy tickets
      with cash (buses can't give change, so make sure you have the exact fare), or mobile
      tickets via the Transport for Edinburgh app, which will also help you plan routes
      and see real-time information on buses.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://edinburghtrams.com/">Edinburgh trams</a> run between the airport and St
      Andrews Square, at the east end of Princes Street.  If you’re taking the tram, buy
      tickets before you board.  Ticket machines are located at each stop.
      </p>
    <h3>By Taxi</h3>
    <p>
      There are multiple taxi companies in Edinburgh.  Black cabs can be hailed on the
      street, although at busy times they may only pick up from licensed taxi ranks.
      There are several taxi ranks on George St, including outside the Assembly Rooms.  A
      full list can be found <a href="https://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/public-transport/taxi-ranks">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Uber and Gett are also available in Edinburgh.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a  href="https://www.citycabs.co.uk">City Cabs</a></li>
      <li><a  href="https://www.taxis-edinburgh.co.uk/">Central Taxis</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>By Bike</h3>
    <p>
      If you're happy cycling up some hills, cycling can be a very effective way to get
      around Edinburgh, especially if you're staying near one of the off-road cycle
      routes. You can hire bikes (including e-bikes) from the following hire shops:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://cyclescotland.co.uk/">Cycle Scotland</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.biketrax.co.uk/hire/">Bike Trax</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://tartanbiketours.co.uk/bike-hire/">Tartan Bicycle</a></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    If you do decide to cycle, please be very careful near the tram lines, as there have
    been a number of serious accidents crossing the tracks.
    </p>
    <h3>By Car</h3>
    <p>
      We don't recommend driving into the city each day as the roads can be very busy
      during peak times, and Edinburgh has restricted (and expensive!) on-street parking
      in the city centre.  If you do drive, there is limited metered
      <a href="https://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/parking-spaces/find-parking-bays/1">on-street
      parking</a> on George Street and surrounding streets.  The nearest multi-storey car
      parks are at <a href="https://www.ncp.co.uk/find-a-car-park/car-parks/edinburgh-castle-terrace/">Castle Terrace</a> (11 minute walk), the
      <a href="https://www.q-park.co.uk/en-gb/cities/edinburgh/omni/">Omni centre</a> (13
      minute walk) and the
      <a href="https://stjamesquarter.com/car-park">St James Quarter</a> (10 minute walk).

  </header>
  <div class="row column">
    <p>
      If you have some free time around the conference, there are many things to do nearby.
    </p>
    <h3>Walking</h3>
    <p>
      One of the best ways to explore the city is to walk.  The Old Town especially has
      all sorts of tiny hidden courtyards, staircases and narrow alleys to explore that
      you’ll only find on foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re up for a more challenging walk, head out to
      Holyrood Park, and a hike up <a href="https://www.earthtrekkers.com/arthurs-seat-volcano-edinburgh/">Arthur’s Seat</a> (an extinct volcano).  Or take a
      walk up
      <a href="https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/lothian/calton-hill.shtml">Calton Hill</a>
      for spectacular views of the city.
    </p>
    <h3>Museums and Galleries</h3>
    <p>Entry to the majority of museums and galleries in Edinburgh is free.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.nms.ac.uk/national-museum-of-scotland/">National Museum of Scotland</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.edinburghmuseums.org.uk/venue/museum-edinburgh">Museum of Edinburgh</a></li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Royal Botanic Garden</h3>
    <p>
    Founded in 1670, the <a href="https://www.rbge.org.uk/visit/royal-botanic-garden-edinburgh/">Garden</a>
    covers 72 acres in the city centre and is a 20 minute walk from the conference venue.
    It is open daily, and admission is free.

  <div class="row column">
    <p>
    Unfairly described by Mike Myers as "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CloGus131G0">the result of a dare</a>",
    Scottish cuisine is actually something you should try! As well as the more famous (or
    maybe infamous!) dishes, as a country with a high proportion of coastline, fish and
    seafood is generally very good here. As well as Scottish and British restaurants,
    Edinburgh has a thriving constellation of restaurants specialising in cuisine from
    around the World.
    </p>
    <h3>Haggis (and other Scottish Cuisine)</h3>
    <p>
      Haggis is a traditional dish, consisting of the bits of a sheep that you don't want
      to think about, stuffed into the stomach of a sheep, and boiled! It sounds terrible,
      but is actually delicious, providing you know where to go to get a good one!
      Vegetarian and vegan versions also exist, and are equally delicious.
      We recommend <a href="https://www.howies.uk.com/">Howies</a>, which has three
      different restaurants specialising in a range of traditional and modern Scottish
      food. Fish & Chip shops also sell haggis, but it's sold as a battered, deep-fried
      sausage, not the traditional dish served with neeps and tatties. For a more
      contemporary take on Scottish fusion cuisine, check out <a href="http://www.stacpolly.com/">Stac Polly</a>.
      </p>
    <h3>Deep-Fried Mars Bar</h3>
    <p>
    A deep-fried Mars Bar is Scotland's 'street food'. Usually bought in a Fish & Chip
    shop after a night drinking too much, it's not exactly refined cuisine, but it is
    recommended that you try it at least once! <a href="https://cafepiccante.com/">Café
    Piccante</a> on Broughton St is probably the best known for this but many Fish & Chip
    shops will fry it for you. Just be warned you may need to go for a run the next day to
    work off the calories!
    </p>
    <h3>Fish & Chips</h3>
    <p>
    Fish & Chips is a classic British dish, consisting of cod or haddock, deep fried in
    batter. The correct way to order it in Scotland is to ask for a Fish Supper (the
    "supper" means "with chips") and you'll be asked if you want Salt'n'Sauce. The sauce
    they're referring to is an Edinburgh tradition, and is slightly different in each
    shop. It's a mix of malt vinegar and brown sauce. You can say no, but be aware that
    you may get a strange look from the server. Good venues for Fish & Chips are:
    <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.lalbadoro.com/">L'Alba D'Oro</a>- Shirley Manson's favourite
    Fish & Chip shop, when she's back in town. You can get classic Fish & Chips here, or
    some more refined variants.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.thecityrestaurant.co.uk/">City Restaurant</a> - cheap, friendly and relaxed, and a favourite with students.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.thefishmarketnewhaven.co.uk/">The Fishmarket</a> - a little
    further away on the coast in Newhaven but well worth a visit for the freshest possible
    fish & chips, sourced from the excellent
    <a href="https://www.welchfishmongers.com">Welch Fishmongers</a> next door.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h3>Burgers</h3>
    <p>
    You'll find a few branches of burger chains such as <a href="https://restaurants.fiveguys.co.uk/search?q=55.953345599999984%2C-3.1883749&qp=Edinburgh,%20City%20of%20Edinburgh,%20Scotland,%20United%20Kingdom&l=en_GB">Five Guys</a> around Edinburgh,
    but the real place to go is <a href="http://www.breadmeatsbread.com/">Bread Meats
    Bread</a>, a Glasgow institution that came to Edinburgh a few years ago and is
    thriving here.
    </p>
  <h3>Restaurants</h3>
  <p>
  The Assembly Rooms’ location on George Street means that you’re not short of nearby
  options for good food.  On George Street itself you’ll find restaurants providing a
  variety of cuisine, including some well known names such as
  <a href="https://www.browns-restaurants.co.uk/restaurants/scotlandandnorthernireland/edinburgh/">Browns</a>, local tapas chain
  <a href="https://www.cafeandaluz.com/">Cafe Andaluz</a>, and more.  Just off George Street, some more hidden favourites include
  <a href="https://www.hakatayauk.com/">Hakataya</a>, for the best tonkatsu ramen in town.
  </p>
  <p>
  Websites such as <a href="https://www.5pm.co.uk/">5pm</a>
  and <a href="https://www.opentable.co.uk/">opentable</a> can be useful for last minute
  table reservations.
  </p>
  <h3>Pubs and Bars</h3>
  <p>
  An evening in the pub with a beer or a whisky is a favourite pastime in Edinburgh,
  although in recent years gin has become an increasingly popular export! As such,
  Edinburgh has many quality pubs and bars, most of which will have a range of excellent
  single-malt whiskies. Many of the pubs around Edinburgh also serve good food!
  </p>
  <p>
  George Street is well placed for several good cocktail bars;
  <a href="https://www.bramblebar.co.uk/">Bramble</a>,
  <a href="http://pandaandsons.com/">Panda & Sons</a>,
  <a href="http://hoottheredeemer.com/">Hoot the Redeemer</a>,
  <a href="https://www.tigerlilyedinburgh.co.uk/">Tiger Lily</a> and the
  <a href="https://www.candybaredinburgh.co.uk/">Candy Bar</a> to name a few.
  </p>
  <p>
  Other good pubs nearby are the
  <a href="https://theabbotsford.com/">Abbotsford</a> for more traditional beer styles,
  <a href="https://www.fiercebeer.com/bars/edinburgh-bar">Fierce Bar</a> and
  <a href="http://thehangingbat.com/">The Hanging Bat</a> for more modern craft beer.
  <a href="http://www.redsquirreledinburgh.co.uk/">Red Squirrel</a> and
  <a href="https://www.brewdog.com/uk/brewdog-lothian-road">Brewdog</a> have good pub food menus. A little further away,
  <a href="https://www.cloistersbar.com/">Cloisters</a> is set in a nice old building, and there's a whole range of other options. For whisky specifically, the
  <a href="https://www.thebowbar.co.uk/">Bow Bar</a> prides itself on its selection and the knowledge of its bar staff.
  </p>
  <p>
  You can also go on a tour of the
  <a href="https://www.edinburghgin.com/">Edinburgh Gin distillery</a>, which is a short
  walk from the Assembly Rooms, and there's a bar in the basement called
  <a href="https://www.headsandtalesbar.com/">Head and Tales</a>.
  </p>
  <h3>Coffee</h3>
  <p>
  Edinburgh has a great artisan coffee scene. Near to the Assembly Rooms you'll find
  <a href="https://cairngorm.coffee/">Cairngorm Coffee</a>,
  <a href="https://www.lowdown.coffee/">Lowdown Coffee</a> and
  <a href="https://m.facebook.com/pages/Wellington-Coffee/155017791183994">Wellington Coffee</a>. Further away, you'll find
  <a href="https://www.cult-espresso.com/">Cult Espresso</a>,
  <a href="https://machina-coffee.co.uk/">Machina Espresso</a>,
  <a href="http://www.brewlabcoffee.co.uk/">Brew Lab</a>,
  <a href="https://www.artisanroast.co.uk/">Artisan Roast</a>, and
  <a href="https://twitter.com/castellocoffee">Castello Coffee</a>, among many others!
  </p>
  <h3>Ice Cream</h3>
  <p>
    Despite (or maybe in spite of) the Scottish weather, Edinburgh has a number of must-try
    gourmet ice cream shops!  The most famous is
    <a href="https://www.marysmilkbar.com/">Mary's Milk Bar</a> in the Grassmarket, which
    has queues even in the worst of weathers, and prides itself on its daily changing
    menu.  <a href="https://lucasicecream.co.uk/">Luca's</a> has been an Edinburgh
    institution for over 100 years.
    Also check out <a href="https://www.facebook.com/people/Bon-Bon-Edinburgh/100057023606995/">
