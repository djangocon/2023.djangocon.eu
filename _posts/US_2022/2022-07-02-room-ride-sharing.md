title: Looking to share a room or ride to DjangoCon US 2022?
---

üöóüè® Are you looking to share lodging or transportation in San Diego?

We have a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fSLtE122ZsImD006aOs45-Q4Asd9hAg8-ZLAUoLCajo/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet</a> where you can fill out information to share lodging and/or transportation.

## What are my options?

You can:
1. Share a room or sofa that you have access to in San Diego
2. Share people a ride to/from San Diego International Airport, either in your personal car or a rental
3. Post that you're looking for a place to sleep
4. Post that you need a ride to/from the airport

As always, ask us for help on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/djangocon) or via email: hello (at) djangocon.us!

## Reminder

Our <a href="/conduct/">Code of Conduct</a> applies to all rides/rooms shared through this sheet, like all DjangoCon-related activities.
