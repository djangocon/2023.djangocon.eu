Hello, everyone!  This year, DjangoCon Europe is coming to Edinburgh, Scotland!

We are very excited to announce that the website for DjangoCon Europe 2023 is [live](https://2023.djangocon.eu).

Many thanks to [TorchBox](https://torchbox.com/) for the website design!

The conference will be from Monday 29th May to Friday 2nd June 2023.

- 29-31 May: Talks, Tutorials and Workshops
- 1-2 June: Sprints

Talks, tutorials and workshops will be held at the [Assembly Rooms](/venues/#talks), in 
the heart of Edinburgh's city centre. Sprints will be held at the 
[Biscuit Factory](/venues/#sprints) in Leith.

We'll also have a social event at an amazing venue, [The Caves](/venues/#social)!

The Call for Proposals and ticket sales will be open soon.  In the meantime, you can get an
insight into the city [here](/location). 

We hope we'll see you all at DjangoCon Europe 2023, and don't forget to follow us [@DjangoConEurope](https://twitter.com/djangoconeurope) on Twitter
