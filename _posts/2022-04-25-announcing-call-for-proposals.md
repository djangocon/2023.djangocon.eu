The DjangoCon 2022 organizers are excited to announce that the first in-person DjangoCon since 2019 is now open for talk submissions: [call for proposals](https://pretalx.com/djangocon-2022/cfp)! The deadline for submissions is May 31st, 2022 [AoE](https://time.is/compare/0000_31_May_2022_in_Anywhere_on_Earth). As long as it’s still May 31st anywhere on earth, you can submit your proposal.

We invite you to submit your proposal no matter your background or experience level with Django. Proposals can be from a wide range of topics; non-Django and community topics are welcome. You can look at our [talk schedule](https://2021.djangocon.us/talks/) from last year for reference.

We fancy first-timers! If you haven’t spoken at a conference or given a tutorial before, this is your invitation to do so. Don’t let the idea that you’re not famous or an expert stop you from submitting. It certainly won’t stop us from selecting your talk or tutorial and it won’t stop the audience from enjoying it!

Plus there are perks! Presenters get free admission to DjangoCon US! Grants to assist with your travel and lodging expenses are available as well. Fill out the [Opportunity Grant](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1yc1HqqcJwi669vxTTs1daJbTeiNYwqM2h3gIgqbpWVE/viewform) form by May 31, 2022. Decision notifications will be sent by July 8, 2022.

How about some help?! Presenters, regardless of experience, sometimes want a little help. If you’d like any help in proposing, preparing, or presenting your talk, feel free to contact one of our mentors! A mentor is an experienced presenter who has volunteered to help other presenters. For first-time presenters, non-native English speakers, under-confident or uncertain speakers, or anyone who would just appreciate another set of eyes, our mentors are here to help. You’ll get the best results by forming a relationship with one mentor, rather than contacting several.

And if you would like to be a speaker mentor, let us know!

For more information on talk and tutorial formats, please check out our [speaker information page](https://2022.djangocon.us/speaking/).

We want everyone attending DjangoCon US to feel safe, welcome, and included. To that end, we have a [Code of Conduct](https://2022.djangocon.us/conduct/) for all speakers and attendees.

If you have questions feel free [to contact us](mailto:hello@djangocon.us).

We look forward to your proposals!
