We have a wide variety of volunteer slots available! If you’d like to sign up for one (or more) we have a [handy spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VO8Xh6xPOQb32WjUD7pKJCMXvqCdcMz95CqIoNToUsA/edit#gid=0). Here's more information on each role.

## Session Chairs

**Session chairs** help foster a supportive environment by welcoming guests, introducing speakers, and making sure folks get to where they need to be. You are the moderator of the session. You’ll arrive in the room where the talks on your schedule take place 10 minutes before the talk starts. Meet your speaker and find out a few things: how do you pronounce your name? Do you want to take questions? How do you want us to count down time? There will be a handy questionnaire on your clipboard to assist with this. At showtime, you’ll introduce the speaker to the audience, keeping it simple — their name, where they’re from, and talk title. During the talk, watch the clock and let the speaker know how much time they have left before questions (show signs at the -15, -10 and -5 mark). Mediate questions (if any), and let the speaker and attendees know when it’s time to wrap it all up. After that, help the speaker disconnect the microphone and make any announcements. There will be a session manager checking in to support you throughout your shift.

## Swag Bag Stuffing

We'll be stuffing swag bags for everyone on Sunday afternoon! If you'll be around and not in a tutorial, we'd appreciate your help. The more people we have, the faster it will go.

## Registration Desk

We'll need people at the registration desk to check people into the conference and help answer questions. Shifts are one hour long, and you'll always have a partner working with you!

## Sprint Mentors, Volunteers, and Git Help Desk

Sign up to help mentor or run errands at the sprints. For this volunteer opportunity, you just need to be willing to help newcomers to the sprints make their first commits!

The Git Help Desk will help Git newbies make their first PRs and free up the sprint mentors for questions about the sprint projects.
