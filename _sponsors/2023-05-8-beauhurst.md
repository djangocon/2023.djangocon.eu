 [Beauhurst](https://www.beauhurst.com/) is the ultimate UK company data source, powered by smart tech and even [smarter people](https://the-beauhurst.notion.site/Software-Engineering-at-Beauhurst-5867af6426064688a8bb7096913043eb). We track every private UK company, with a particular focus on the high-growth ecosystem, helping our customers find, track and understand the market.
 Beyond that, we’re also super proud of the company and community that we’ve built. Our [culture](https://the-beauhurst.notion.site/Culture-at-Beauhurst-ecfe7ded0ed14a57a24fec83942ca5d2) may just be the best thing about Beauhurst—we’re a group of warm and welcoming people, all of whom continually push ourselves and each other to make things better.
 We’re at a pretty exciting stage right now—we’ve built a profitable, high-growth business, with 120+ employees and an enviable client list. But we’re not done yet. We’re on a mission to become a global data company that helps organisations discover and work better with ambitious, high-growth companies.
