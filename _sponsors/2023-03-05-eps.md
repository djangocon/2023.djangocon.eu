  The EuroPython Society (EPS) is a Swedish non-profit organization which organizes EuroPython conferences, supports the Python community in Europe and holds the rights to the EuroPython conference series and trademarks.

  The EPS was formed in 2004, with the mission to turn EuroPython into a successful Python conference series for the years to come. In 2016, we have extended our mission to further the use of the programming language Python in Europe and organize events centered around the programming language Python to support this.
