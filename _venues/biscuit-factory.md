Sprints will be held on 1st and 2nd June at 
<a href="https://www.biscuitfactory.co.uk/">The Biscuit Factory</a>, in Leith.

The Biscuit Factory is a creative arts and events hub.  It was built in 1947 by Crawfords 
Biscuits and is now home to 32 creative businesses who together make a significant contribution to the culture in Leith.  Keeping most of the original fixtures and fittings,
The Biscuit Factory is a unique venue, and an opportunity to experience a different part of the city.

Leith is a port area to the north of the city centre, founded at the mouth of the Water of Leith, with the original harbour dating back to the 14th century. It has a tumultuous history with the rest of the city, and was previously an independent town before being merged into Edinburgh in 1920.
