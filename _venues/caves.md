The social event for this year's DjangoCon Europe will be held at 
<a href="https://unusualvenuesedinburgh.com/venues/the-caves-venue-edinburgh">The Caves</a>.

The Caves is a truly unique venue that makes up the sub-structure of the 18th Century South Bridge. There was once so much whisky stored here that it became known as "Whisky Row"!

Every room has a story to tell and a special place in Scottish history - from vaults that served as the stables to the French Cavalry who were at one time body guards to the Royal Family, to remains of the houses that pre-date the Bridge itself - with the original terracotta floor tiles still intact!
