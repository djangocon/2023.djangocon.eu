Our main venue for conference talks, workshops and tutorials on 29-31st May is 
<a href="https://www.assemblyroomsedinburgh.co.uk/">The Assembly Rooms</a>, in the heart of
Edinburgh's New Town.

The Assembly Rooms is a Georgian building, now restored to her former glory. It is elegantly designed with glittering crystal chandeliers, gleaming gold leaf and impressive gilt mirrors reflecting the history and tradition of the building.  As well as providing a stunning setting for DjangoCon Europe 2023, its location in the very centre of the city makes it perfect for exploring and getting a taste of Edinburgh while you're here.
